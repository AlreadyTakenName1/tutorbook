# `@tutorbook/translations`

This package contains all of the translations for Tutorbook's [new web
app](https://tutorbook.org). We're using
[`react-intl`](https://formatjs.io/docs/react-intl) for the i18n of our website.

Take a look at [this blog
post](https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/internationalization-in-react-apps-using-react-intl-1d72a6f14053)
for some examples that are similar to how we're localizing our website.
