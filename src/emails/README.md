# Emails

This repository contains all of our [Handlebars.js](https://handlebarsjs.com)
email templates. We use [Twilio SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com) to send our
emails and utilize their built-in [Handlebar's
support](https://sendgrid.com/docs/for-developers/sending-email/using-handlebars/#handlebar.js-reference)
to send customized emails (e.g. an email inviting users to attend a new tutoring
lesson).
