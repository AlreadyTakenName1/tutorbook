# Utilities

Included here are some (somewhat) useful sets of utilities. Each directory here
should have it's own `README.md` that can be referred to for usage information,
etc.

Also note that most of these utilities were ported over from [Tutorbook's
primary web app repository](https://github.com/tutorbookapp/tutorbook) and thus
most issues regarding these utilities should be reported there.
