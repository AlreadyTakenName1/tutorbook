# Outreach

We need **@everyone**'s help with our **#outreach** efforts:

1. Ping your own connections for people who'd benefit from a one-on-one
   tutor/mentor. Some suggestions:
   - Families where both parents work (the parents are too busy and their
     children don't have one-on-one support to complete their at-home learning
     assignments).
   - Peers/colleagues that have younger K-12 siblings who'd benefit from a
     **free, expert tutor/mentor**. It should be a no-brainer to contact these
     folks; you'll be doing them a favor.
2. Follow and promote our social accounts (that **@Rash** and **@Christopher**
   have been working so hard on):
   - Follow us on [Instagram](https://instagram.com/tutorbookapp) and make sure
     to re-post on your story.
   - Like us on [Facebook](https://facebook.com/tutorbookapp) and create a post
     telling your Facebook friends about this cool project that you're working
     on (that cool project being [Tutorbook](https://tutorbook.org) OFC haha).
3. Send a quick email to your local newspaper (e.g. the [Palo Alto
   Weekly](https://www.paloaltoonline.com/)) telling them about us and how
   you (and the other members of your local community that I'm sure you've
   already gotten involved) are helping/benefiting!
4. Message **#outreach** on Slack once you've completed steps 1, 2 and 3; we'll
   have more ways you can help spread the word about our nonprofit initiative.
